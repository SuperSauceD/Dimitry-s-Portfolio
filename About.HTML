<!-- Information About Me ! -->

    </main>
			 <p> Cheers ! My name is Dimitry Thelusme and I am in my 4th year at Kennesaw State University, majoring in Information Systems with a minor in Information Technology. Graduating from McEachern High School, I've always had high expectations for my future dealing with college and after completing college. After the first month of college, it felt as if my whole plan for after college that I had been growing since high school had been shattered! I will always cherish Kennesaw State University's endless opportunities to network with others and to explore different walks in life that may hold much influence towards after college. Although I had changed my major about 3 times, Im gratefull for KSU for I would not be who I am today if It wasn't for this school. 

	Although I am a full-time college student, I am a part-time sales associate at a pre-owned car dealership named Carmax. My job does not correlate With my major and minor exactly, but after I finish school, I plan to elevate in my job with my major to work in a higher position. My job may be seen as a time-waster due to its importance to my major, but in fact I love cars and love my job! As much as I see myself thriving within this field of work, I believe I work too hard in school to not focus on making that my main goal. This influenced me to sell cars part time to focus on school full time (plus I love driving the teslas and the corvettes!). Doing this opened my eyes to the idea that not everything has to be learned through college, working and collecting real world experience will effectively grow one's perseverence.

	Kennesaw State's networking opportunities through job and career fairs efficiently opens up our brains to explore all the options the school has to offer for post-graduation. The reason why I changed my major is due to such networking and connecting with different people who operate in different fields for their company. I entered college as a marketing major but up on speaking to someone operating in information Systems and FinTech, I was immediately swooped off my feet and interested in diving into how that field operates. I began my investigation and swapped over with little doubt after consulting with my counselor. One idea about college I believe is truly important is ensuring that you are optimizing your learning and translating it to your growth. One fear that I had about school is not graduating on time and losing home due to having to take excessive amount of classes, what helped my overcome majority of my fears throughout college: My counselor. There is absolutely nothing wrong with seeking help for everybody requires assistance within their life whether it is wanted or not, even if it is a minor push. When in doubt, counselors are available for the betterment of the average student's mental.
